            At the end of the day, a parent wishes that his or her children remain happy and also that the purpose of
            their
            going to a school is fulfilled. <br>
        CLGWS indeed, fulfills these parameters as when I look at my kids when they return home are happy, safe and well
        adapted to the process of learning, what else can I ask for? <br>
        Over here, I have found the atmosphere very congenial as there is a special kind of bonding between the students
        and teachers which is very much suited for wholesome development of students' personality. A well-planned
        curriculum incorporated with adaptive activities oriented towards the growth of students is carried out well all
        through the academic year. <br>
        I have seen my children growing in confidence both in academics as well as extra-curricular activities. Much
        appreciated efforts by CLGWS as a whole!
